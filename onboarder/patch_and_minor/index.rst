How to update a minor version or to apply a patch
=================================================

We frequently release patches for all supported versions. Each patch contains bug fixes and sometimes improvements or
security fixes, **that is why it is very important to always have the latest Onboarder patch installed on your PIM.**

New minor versions bring new features.

Prerequisite
------------

We assume that you are using a project installed from a PIM Enterprise Standard edition (:doc:`/onboarder/installation/index`).
It is especially important that you added the Onboarder Composer upgrade script to your PIM ``composer.json``, as explained in :doc:`/onboarder/installation/index`.
